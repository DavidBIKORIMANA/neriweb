    <h1>A-Level Specializations at GS St. Philippe Neri</h1>
    <p>
        At GS St. Philippe Neri, our A-Level curriculum offers learners the opportunity to specialize in subject streams that align with their academic strengths, interests, and future career goals. This specialized approach ensures focused preparation for university education, professional courses, or technical vocations.
    </p>
    <p>
        We provide a wide range of specializations that reflect both traditional academic disciplines and emerging fields relevant to Rwanda’s socio-economic development. Our experienced teaching staff guide learners in selecting the right pathway based on aptitude assessments, career counseling, and academic performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Common A-Level streams include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>MCB (Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology):</strong> Ideal for learners aspiring to careers in medicine, pharmacy, biotechnology, or life sciences.</li>
        <li><strong>PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics):</strong> Suited for engineering, physical sciences, and technology-related university programs.</li>
        <li><strong>PCB (Physics, Chemistry, Biology):</strong> Focused on health sciences, environmental studies, and biological research.</li>
        <li><strong>MPG (Mathematics, Physics, Geography):</strong> Prepares students for fields like geospatial analysis, environmental management, and urban planning.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition to these core science specializations, learners can choose elective subjects such as Economics, Literature, and ICT to broaden their skill sets. This flexibility encourages interdisciplinary competence and adaptability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the A-Level program, learners engage in practical experiments, research projects, and advanced coursework that deepen their understanding and promote critical thinking. Our modern laboratories and resource centers support experiential learning, while career guidance services assist with university application and scholarship opportunities.
