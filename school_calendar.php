    <h1>Academic Calendar for 2025</h1>
    <p>
        GS St. Philippe Neri follows a well-structured academic calendar that balances instruction time, exams, and holidays to ensure an optimal learning experience. The calendar is designed to align with national education guidelines and local needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each academic year is divided into three terms, with regular breaks that allow learners and teachers to rest and prepare for the next term. We also incorporate public holidays and special school events into the calendar to maintain an active and engaged school community.
    </p>

        Special events such as sports days, cultural festivals, and parent-teacher meetings are scheduled throughout the year and communicated well in advance to all learners and parents. This helps in fostering a strong partnership between the school and families.

        We encourage learners and staff to plan their activities around this calendar to maximize attendance and participation. Please check this calendar regularly for any updates or changes.
