    <h1>Comprehensive Curriculum at GS St. Philippe Neri</h1>
    <p>
        The comprehensive curriculum at GS St. Philippe Neri is carefully designed to provide learners with a broad, balanced, and integrated education that meets both national standards and the evolving demands of the modern world. Our curriculum covers six years of secondary education, ranging from Senior 1 to Senior 6, ensuring learners progressively build foundational knowledge before specializing in advanced fields.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the early secondary levels (Senior 1 to Senior 3), learners engage with a diverse range of subjects including Mathematics, English, Kinyarwanda, Science, Social Studies, and Information Communication Technology (ICT). This foundational phase aims to develop critical thinking, communication skills, and basic scientific understanding, preparing learners for higher academic challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        From Senior 4 onwards, learners choose specialized streams based on their strengths, interests, and career aspirations. These streams include Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology (MCB); Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics (PCM); Physics, Chemistry, Geography (MPG); and Physics, Chemistry, Biology (PCB), among others. This specialization facilitates deeper learning and mastery in chosen disciplines, thus equipping learners for university education or vocational pathways.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our curriculum also emphasizes continuous assessment alongside national examinations. Practical laboratory work, project-based learning, and regular class tests promote experiential understanding and application of knowledge. Cross-curricular projects foster collaboration, problem-solving, and innovation skills essential for 21st-century learners.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to academics, our curriculum integrates values education, digital literacy, and environmental awareness, shaping well-rounded citizens who contribute positively to society. Learners receive guidance counseling to support academic progress and career decision-making.
