    <h1>Interactive Learning Methods at GS St. Philippe Neri</h1>
    <p>
        GS St. Philippe Neri is committed to transforming the learning experience through interactive methods that actively engage learners in their education. Moving beyond traditional lecture-based teaching, we employ various approaches designed to stimulate critical thinking, collaboration, and practical application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interactive learning promotes a learner-centered environment where learners participate actively rather than passively absorbing information. Techniques such as group discussions, problem-solving activities, role-playing, simulations, and hands-on experiments enable learners to internalize concepts more deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
        Technology plays a key role in our interactive learning strategy. Digital tools such as educational apps, virtual labs, interactive whiteboards, and online quizzes provide immediate feedback and motivate learners to improve. Blended learning models combine face-to-face instruction with online resources to enhance accessibility and convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Collaborative learning is also encouraged through project-based assignments and peer teaching. These methods build communication skills, teamwork, and leadership, essential qualities for success beyond school.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, formative assessments integrated into lessons allow teachers to track learner progress continuously and tailor instruction to meet individual needs. This feedback loop fosters a growth mindset and lifelong learning habits.
